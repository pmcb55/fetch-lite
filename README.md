This is the light version of the `rdf-fetch` package without the `rdf-formats-common` dependency.
It can be usefully if you want to make a Browserify build with a reduced set of parsers and serializers.
The `formats` options is required for this package.
For further details see the `rdf-fetch` documentation.
